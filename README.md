## Overview
This is an appointment planner app created using react.js. This project has been done for the purpose of practicing React.js concepts such as React router, function components, hooks and states. The application allows the user to add contacts using their name, phone number and email. After a contact has been added, the user can then create an appointment using a title, date and time, and then selecting a contact. The styling of the website is very simple as the functionality was the main aim.
